<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
My research about IoT systems developed UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) and developed several projects about embedded systems. In the near future, my aim is to become a software engineer who works on projects about UAVs, IoT, automotive, and embedded systems.

## 📜 History

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
I have a background in Computer Engineering from Hanoi University of Science and Technology and practical experience in embedded and wireless networking systems. Early in my career, I worked at the Embedded Networking Laboratory (EmNetLab), where I developed IoT and UAV-related systems.

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Currently, I am an Embedded Software Engineer at Viettel High Technology Industries Corporation (VHT), working on firmware development for network devices. My expertise includes Wi-Fi driver development, Wi-Fi EasyMesh networking, and performance optimization. I contribute to delivering robust, interoperable, and high-reliability wireless solutions for transport and carrier-grade networks.
