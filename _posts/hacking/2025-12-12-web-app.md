# Web Server and Web Application Attacks
{: #overview}

![Web App Attack](/assets/img/hacking/web_app_attack.png)

Modern penetration testing often begins at the web layer. This post summarises typical vulnerabilities against web servers and applications, and provides hands‑on lab steps using popular tools.

> **Reminder:** Only test in a lawful and authorized environment (e.g. your own lab VM or the OWASP Juice Shop/Metasploitable web apps).

## 1. Common Vulnerability Classes

* **Injection (SQL, Command)** – unsanitized input inserted into queries or commands
* **Cross‑Site Scripting (XSS)** – attacker-supplied script executes in victim’s browser
* **Broken Authentication/Session Management** – weak credentials, exposed tokens
* **Insecure Direct Object References** – accessing data by modifying identifiers
* **Security Misconfiguration** – default credentials, verbose error messages
* **Sensitive Data Exposure** – plaintext credentials, weak encryption

Each category corresponds to an OWASP Top‑10 item and is worth mapping during reconnaissance.

## 2. Essential Tools

| Tool | Usage | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Burp Suite** | Intercept and modify HTTP(S) traffic | Community edition good for manual testing |
| **OWASP ZAP** | Proxy, spider, active scanners | Free and scriptable with Python/Jython |
| **sqlmap** | Automate SQL injection discovery/exploitation | Supports many DBMS, fingerprinting |
| **Nikto** | Web server scanner | Detects outdated software, misconfigurations |

## 3. Lab Examples

### A. SQL Injection (Manual + sqlmap)
1. Identify parameter vulnerable to injection (e.g. `http://target/page?id=1`).
2. Confirm with single-quote `'` or payload `' OR '1'='1`.
3. Launch sqlmap:
```bash
sqlmap -u "http://target/page?id=1" --dbs
```
4. Dump a table: `--dump -T users`

### B. Cross‑Site Scripting
1. In Burp, intercept a request with a text parameter.
2. Inject `<script>alert(1)</script>` and forward. If reflected, the page is vulnerable.
3. For stored XSS, submit the payload in a comment or profile field and revisit.

### C. Directory Traversal
Attempt to read `/etc/passwd` from a web server:
```
http://target/file?name=../../../../etc/passwd
```

### D. File Upload Abuse
1. Upload a web shell disguised as an image.
2. Access via `http://target/uploads/shell.php`.

## 5. Lab Questions

1. What are the main differences between SQL injection and XSS?
2. Why is input validation important?
3. How do proxy tools assist in web testing?
4. What is a common indicator of a directory traversal vulnerability?
