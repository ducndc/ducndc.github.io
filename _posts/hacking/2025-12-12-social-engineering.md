# Understanding Social Engineering Attacks

Social engineering is the art of manipulating people's psychology to reveal confidential information or perform actions that benefit the attacker.

---

## 1. Common Types of Social Engineering

### A. Impersonation
This is the most common human-based social engineering technique.

* **Mechanism:** The attacker pretends to be a legitimate or authoritative person.

* **Method:** Performed in person (face-to-face) or through media such as phone calls, emails, etc.

* **Objective:** To trick the victim into revealing sensitive information.

### B. Phishing
Phishing is the act of sending invalid emails impersonating reputable websites/organizations to steal users' personal information or account details.

#### Types of Phishing:
* **Spear Phishing:** A targeted attack on a specific individual or organization.

* **Whaling:** Targeting "big" targets such as CEOs or senior managers.

* **Pharming:** Attackers install malicious software to redirect web traffic from a legitimate site to a fake website.

* **Spimming:** Phishing attacks via instant messaging.

#### Tools to Support Phishing:

* **The Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET):** A powerful toolset for simulating attacks.

* **ShellPhish:** An automated tool for creating fake pages.

## 2. Other Computer-Based Social Engineering Techniques

Attackers use software and computer interfaces to deceive users:

* **Pop-Up Windows:** Fake notification pop-ups.

* **Hoax Letters:** Scam emails (e.g., fake prize notifications).

* **Chain Letters:** Misleading or promising forwarded emails.

* **Instant Chat Messenger:** Online messaging scams.

* **Spam Email:** Spam containing malicious content or fraudulent advertisements.

* **Scareware:** Scary software (e.g., fake virus alerts) to force users to install malware.

## 3. Practice with Social-Engineer Toolkit (setoolkit)

SET tools are often used in lab exercises to demonstrate attack capabilities:
* **Creating Web Clones:** Copying the interface of a popular website (such as Facebook, Gmail) to steal login information when the victim enters it into the fake page.

## 4. Mobile Application Attacks

Attackers exploit users' trust in app stores:

* **Publishing Malicious Apps:** Releasing applications containing malicious code directly to the store.

* **Repackaging Legitimate Apps:** Taking legitimate applications, inserting malicious code inside, then repackaging and distributing them to steal user data.
