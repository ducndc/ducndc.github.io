## Overview

This is my personal collection of essential technical books organized by topic. Each category includes curated resources for learning and reference. Books are available in PDF format (local storage) or linked to external sources.

> 📚 **Note**: This library is continuously updated as I discover and read new resources. Most books are technical references for embedded systems, kernel development, and computer science fundamentals.
