To design a system for software, you will need to combine knowledge in many areas not only programming, but also architectural thinking, project management and understanding user needs. If it is a complex hardware/software product such as Access Point (AP), the knowledge to design the system will be broader than pure software, because it must combine hardware, software, network, security and manufacturing techniques.

## 1. Hardware knowledge

### 1.1 Microprocessor and SoC architecture
- ARM, MIPS or specialized Wi-Fi chips (MediaTek, Qualcomm, Broadcom ...).

### 1.2 Circuits and RF
- PCB design, RF matching, antenna (omni, sector, MIMO).

- Knowledge of frequency bands (2.4GHz, 5GHz, 6GHz).

### 1.3 Hardware communication standards
- SPI, I²C, UART, PCIe, Ethernet PHY.

### 1.4 Power and energy management
- PoE (Power over Ethernet) standard 802.3af/at/bt.

- Protection against electric shock, anti-interference.

## 2. Knowledge of embedded systems

### 2.1 Embedded operating systems
- OpenWrt, Linux Embedded, Yocto, or custom firmware.

### 2.2 Device drivers
- Wi-Fi drivers (MAC, PHY), Ethernet, LED, push buttons, USB.

### 2.3 Limited memory and resource management
- Low RAM/Flash, weak CPU → optimize code and kernel configuration.

### 2.4 Bootloader

- U-Boot, firmware recovery mechanism, dual image.

## 3. Network and protocol knowledge

### 3.1 Wi-Fi standards

- IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax (Wi-Fi 6/6E).
- OFDMA, MU-MIMO, Beamforming, DFS, CCA.

### 3.2 Mesh Networking

- EasyMesh, 802.11s, proprietary mesh protocols.

### 3.3 Connection management

- Roaming, band steering, load balancing.

### 3.4 Network security
- WPA2/WPA3, 802.1X, RADIUS, certificate-based authentication.

### 3.5 Remote administration
- TR-069, SNMP, Netconf, cloud controller.

## 4. System Software Knowledge

### 4.1 Configuration Management and CLI/Web UI
- Web admin (HTML/JS), command-line (BusyBox).

### 4.2 Background Services
- Hostapd, wpa_supplicant, dnsmasq, dropbear SSH.

### 4.3 API and Centralized Administration
- REST, MQTT, WebSocket for Controller.

### 4.4 Firmware Update Mechanism
- OTA (Over-the-Air), Brick Protection.

## 5. Testing and Optimization Knowledge

### 5.1 RF Testing
- Test transmit power, receive sensitivity, channel occupancy.

### 5.2 Network Performance
- Throughput, latency, jitter, QoS.

### 5.3 Load Capacity
- Multiple STAs (stations) simultaneously, stress testing.

### 5.4 Information security
- Penetration test, firmware security vulnerability test.

## 6. Manufacturing and certification process

### 6.1 Certifications and standards
- FCC, CE, RoHS, Wi-Fi Alliance.

### 6.2 Supply chain and BOM
- Component management, cost optimization.

### 6.3 Production line test
- Automatic RF, Ethernet, basic function testing before packaging.
