<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Debuggers are just tools that allow you to find the false assumption. Your program runs
under the debugger's control, allowing you to stop your program and examine memory to
find the false assumption. It's up to you to fully understand your code so you have a
reasonable idea of which part of the code on which to focus.
</div>

## Starting and stopping GDB

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
To run your program under GDB's control, type "gdb program_name" at the Linux prompt. Do not enter your program's command line arguments. We'll do
that later.
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
To exit GDB, type "quit" (abbreviated q) at the GDB prompt
</div>

## GDB commands

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Commands entered at the GDB prompt may be abbreviated to the shortest unique
completion. Several common commands may be abbreviated to a single character, even
though other commands start with that same character.
</div>

| Character | Command | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **b**     | breakpoint | Set a place where GDB stops executing your program |
| **c**     | continue   | Continue program execution |
| **l**     | list       | List source code |
| **n**     | next       | Execute the next line of code, then stop |
| **p**     | print      | Print the value of a variable or expression |
| **q**     | quit       | Quit GDB |
| **r**     | run        | Run your program from the beginning |
| **s**     | step       | Step to the next line of code |
| **x**     | examine    | Examine memory |

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Entering GDB commands allow "auto completion". Enter TAB to complete your
command. Arrow keys are available to see prior commands.
</div>

## Help

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
GDB provides internal help for the user. Typing help at the command line prints a list of
command categories. You can them type help category or help command for more
specific help. The apropos command can be used to find commands.
</div>

## Basic Debugging

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Use the run (abbreviated r) command to start your program under GDB. If your
program requires command line arguments, provide them to the run command. E.g. the
command "run 12 bob"
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
begins executing your program, passing the command line arguments "12" and "bob" to
main( ). Unix redirection may also be used with the run command. To get the user input
from a file type the command "run < filename". You can use run to restart your program at any time within GDB.
</div>

##  Breakpoints and watchpoints

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
The principal purposes of using a debugger are so that you can stop your program before
it terminates; or so that, if your program runs into trouble, you can investigate and find
out why. 
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Inside GDB, your program may stop for any of several reasons, such as a signal, a
breakpoint, or reaching a new line after a GDB command such as step. You may then
examine and change variables, set new breakpoints or remove old ones, and then
continue execution. Usually, the messages shown by GDB provide ample explanation of
the status of your program--but you can also explicitly request this information at any
time. 
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
A breakpoint tells GDB to stop your program's execution when a certain point is reached
in your program. For each breakpoint, you can add conditions to control in finer detail
whether your program stops. You can set breakpoints with the break command and its
variants to specify the place where your program should stop by line number, function
name or exact address in the program.
</div>

```bash
break line number
break function name
break
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
To set a breakpoint, use the break (abbreviated b) command. The break
command's arguments may be a line number, a function name, or the address of
an instruction. With no arguments, the break command sets a breakpoint at the
next instruction to be executed.
</div>

```bash
break location if condition
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
A breakpoint may have an associated Boolean condition. GDB will stop your
program's execution at the breakpoint only if the Boolean condition is true
where location is a line number, function name, etc.
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
You can get information about all the breakpoints you've set using the info command
</div>

```bash
info breakpoints
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
You can use a watchpoint to stop execution whenever the value of an expression changes,
without having to predict a particular place where this may happen. (This is sometimes
called a data breakpoint.) The expression may be as simple as the value of a single
variable, or as complex as many variables combined by operators. 
</div>

Examples include: 

- A reference to the value of a single variable.
- An address cast to an appropriate data type. For example, `*(int
*)0x12345678' will watch a 4-byte region at the specified address (assuming
an int occupies 4 bytes). 
- An arbitrarily complex expression, such as `a*b + c/d'. The expression can
use any operators valid in the program's native language
- You can set a watchpoint on an expression even if the expression can not be
evaluated yet.

```bash
watch expr
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Set a watchpoint for an expression. GDB will break when the expression expr is
written into by the program and its value changes. The simplest (and the most
popular) use of this command is to watch the value of a single variable:
</div>

```bash
watch total
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
You can get information about all the watchpoints you've set using the info command
info watchpoints
</div>

## Continuing and stepping

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Continuing means resuming program execution until your program completes normally.
In contrast, stepping means executing just one more "step" of your program, where "step"
may mean either one line of source code, or one machine instruction (depending on what
particular command you use). Either when continuing or when stepping, your program
may stop even sooner, due to a breakpoint or a signal.
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
A typical technique for using stepping is to set a breakpoint at the beginning of the
function or the section of your program where a problem is believed to lie, run your
program until it stops at that breakpoint, and then step through the suspect area,
examining the variables that are interesting, until you see the problem happen. 
</div>

```bash
continue (abbreviated c)
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
The continue command resumes your program's execution from the address at
which it was stopped (probably a breakpoint), and runs your program to the next
breakpoint or until your program exits normally.
</div>

```bash
step (abbreviated s)
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
The step command continues running your program until control reaches a
different source line, then stops it and returns control to GDB. The step
command only stops at the first instruction of a source line. The step command
continues to stop if a function that has debugging information is called within the
line. In other words, step steps inside any functions called within the line. 
</div>

```bash
step count
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Continue running as in step, but do so count times. If a breakpoint is reached, or
a signal not related to stepping occurs before count steps, stepping stops right
away. 
</div>

```bash
next [count]
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Continue to the next source line in the current (innermost) stack frame. This is
similar to step, but function calls that appear within the line of code are
executed without stopping. Execution stops when control reaches a different line
of code at the original stack level that was executing when you gave the next
command. This command is abbreviated n. The optional argument count is a
repeat count, as for step. 
</div>

```bash
stepi
stepi arg
si
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Execute one machine instruction, then stop and return to the debugger.
It is often useful to do `display/i $pc' when stepping by machine
instructions. This makes GDB automatically display the next instruction to be
executed, each time your program stops. The argument arg is a repeat count, as
in step. 
</div>

```bash
nexti
nexti arg
ni
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Execute one machine instruction, but if it is a function call, proceed until the
function returns. The argument arg is a repeat count, as in next. 
</div>

## Examining the stack

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
When your program has stopped, the first thing you need to know is where it stopped and
how it got there.
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Each time your program performs a function call, information about the call is generated.
That information includes the location of the call in your program, the arguments of the
call, and the local variables of the function being called. The information is saved in a
block of data called a stack frame. The stack frames are allocated in a region of memory
called the call stack. 
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
When your program stops, the GDB commands for examining the stack allow you to see
all of this information. 
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
One of the stack frames is selected by GDB and many GDB commands refer implicitly to
the selected frame. In particular, whenever you ask GDB for the value of a variable in
your program, the value is found in the selected frame. By default, the current stack
frame is used. The call stack is divided up into contiguous pieces called stack frames, or
frames for short; each frame is the data associated with one call to one function. The
frame contains the arguments given to the function, the function's local variables, and the
address at which the function is executing. 
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
When your program is started, the stack has only one frame, that of the function main.
This is called the initial frame or the outermost frame. Each time a function is called, a
new frame is made. Each time a function returns, the frame for that function invocation is
eliminated. If a function is recursive, there can be many frames for the same function.
The frame for the function in which execution is actually occurring is called the
innermost frame. This is the most recently created of all the stack frames that still exist. 
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Inside your program, stack frames are identified by their addresses. A stack frame
consists of many bytes, each of which has its own address; each kind of computer has a
convention for choosing one byte whose address serves as the address of the frame.
Usually this address is kept in a register called the frame pointer register while execution
is going on in that frame. 
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
GDB assigns numbers to all existing stack frames, starting with zero for the innermost
frame, one for the frame that called it, and so on upward. These numbers do not really
exist in your program; they are assigned by GDB to give you a way of designating stack
frames in GDB commands.
</div>

```bash
frame arg
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
The frame command allows you to move from one stack frame to another, and to
print the stack frame you select. arg may be either the address of the frame or the
stack frame number. Without an argument, frame prints the current stack frame.
</div>

```bash
select-frame
```
<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
The select-frame command allows you to move from one stack frame to
another without printing the frame. This is the silent version of frame. 
</div>

## Backtraces

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
A backtrace is a summary of how your program got where it is. It shows one line per
frame, for many frames, starting with the currently executing frame (frame zero),
followed by its caller (frame one), and on up the stack. The backtrace (or where)
command prints information about the call stack.
</div>

```bash
backtrace
bt
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Print a backtrace of the entire stack: one line per frame for all frames in the stack.
You can stop the backtrace at any time by typing the system interrupt character,
normally Ctrl-c. 
</div>

```bash
backtrace n
bt n
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Similar, but print only the innermost n frames. 
</div>

```bash
backtrace full
bt full
bt full n
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Print the values of the local variables also. n specifies the number of frames to
print, as described above. 
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
When your program terminates because of a "seg fault" or other failure, the operating
system saves a copy of your program at the time of the termination. This copy is saved in
a "core file" which is named core.pid, where pid is the process id number of your
program when it was running (e.g. core.1357). By using GDB to look at the core file,
(e.g. gdb core.1357), you can tell exactly where your program terminated -- just use the
backtrace command. You'll see the entire list of stack frames. Stack frame #0 is where
your program terminated -- you'll see the function name and line number
</div>

## Examining source code

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
DB can print parts of your program's source, since the debugging information recorded in
the program tells GDB what source files were used to build it. When your program stops,
GDB spontaneously prints the line where it stopped. Likewise, when you select a stack
frame, GDB prints the line where execution in that frame has stopped. You can print
other portions of source files by explicit command.
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
To print lines from a source file, use the list command (abbreviated l). By default, ten
(10) lines are printed. Here are the forms of the list command most commonly used: 
</div>

```bash
list linenum
list filename:linenum
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Print lines centered around line number linenum in the current source file. 
</div>

```bash
list function
list filename:function
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Print lines centered around the beginning of function function. 
</div>

```bash
list
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Print more lines. If the last lines printed were printed with a list command, this
prints lines following the last lines printed; however, if the last line printed was a
solitary line printed as part of displaying a stack frame prints lines centered
around that line. 
</div>

```bash
list -
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Print lines just before the lines last printed.
</div>

```bash
list *address
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Specifies the program address address. This specifies a source line that contains
address.
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
By default, GDB prints ten (10) source lines with any of these forms of the list
command. You can change this using set listsize:
</div>

## Examining Data

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
The usual way to examine data in your program is with the print command (abbreviated
p). It evaluates and prints the value of an expression of the language in which your
program is written.
</div>

```bash
print expr
print /f expr
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
expr is an expression (in the source language). By default the value of expr is
printed in a format appropriate to its data type; you can choose a different format
by specifying `/f', where f is a letter specifying the format.
</div>

```bash
print
print /f
```
<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
If you omit expr, GDB displays the last value again. This allows you to
conveniently inspect the same value in an alternative format. 
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
By default, GDB prints a value according to its data type. Sometimes this is not what you
want. For example, you might want to print a number in hex, or a pointer in decimal. Or
you might want to view data in memory at a certain address as a character string or as an
instruction. To do these things, specify an output format when you print a value. 
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
The simplest use of output formats is to say how to print a value already computed. This
is done by starting the arguments of the print command with a slash and a format letter.
The format letters supported are:
</div>

x -- regard the bits of the value as an integer, and print the integer in hexadecimal.

d -- print as integer in signed decimal.

u -- print as integer in unsigned decimal.

o -- print as integer in octal.

t -- print as integer in binary. The letter `t' stands for "two".

a -- print as an address, both absolute in hexadecimal and as an offset from the nearest
preceding symbol. You can use this format used to discover where (in what function) an
unknown address is located: 

```bash
(gdb) p/a 0x54320
$3 = 0x54320 <_initialize_vx+396>
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
c -- regard as an integer and print it as a character constant. This prints both the
numerical value and its character representation. The character representation is replaced
with the octal escape `\nnn' for characters outside the 7-bit ASCII range. Without this
format, GDB displays char, unsigned char, and signed char data as character
constants. Single-byte members of vectors are displayed as integer data. 
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
f -- regard the bits of the value as a floating point number and print using typical
floating point syntax. 
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
s -- regard as a string, if possible. With this format, pointers to single-byte data are
displayed as null-terminated strings and arrays of single-byte data are displayed as fixedlength strings. Other values are displayed in their natural types. Without this format, GDB displays pointers to and arrays of char, unsigned char, and signed char as
strings. Single-byte members of a vector are displayed as an integer array. 
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
r -- print using the `raw' formatting. By default, GDB will use a type-specific prettyprinter. The `r' format bypasses any pretty-printer which might exist for the value's
type. 
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
If you find that you want to print the value of an expression frequently (to see how it
changes), you might want to add it to the automatic display list so that GDB prints its
value each time your program stops. Each expression added to the list is given a number
to identify it; to remove an expression from the list, you specify that number. The
automatic display looks like this:
</div>

```bash
2: foo = 38
3: bar[5] = (struct hack *) 0x3804
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
This display shows item numbers, expressions and their current values. As with displays
you request manually using x or print, you can specify the output format you prefer; in
fact, display decides whether to use print or x depending your format specification--it
uses x if you specify either the `i' or `s' format, or a unit size; otherwise it uses
print. 
</div>

```bash
display expr
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Add the expression expr to the list of expressions to display each time your
program stops.
display does not repeat if you press RET again after using it. 
</div>

```bash
display/fmt expr
```
<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
For fmt specifying only a display format and not a size or count, add the
expression expr to the auto-display list but arrange to display it each time in the
specified format fmt. See Output Formats above. 
</div>

```bash
display/fmt addr
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
For fmt `i' or `s', or including a unit-size or a number of units, add the
expression addr as a memory address to be examined each time your program
stops. Examining means in effect doing `x/fmt addr'.
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
For example, `display/i $pc' can be helpful, to see the machine instruction about
to be executed each time execution stops (`$pc' is a common name for the program
counter; see the section on Registers below.
</div>

## Examining Memory

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
You can use the command x (for "examine") to examine memory in any of several
formats, independently of your program's data types. 
</div>

```bash
x/nfu addr
x addr
x
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
n, f, and u are all optional parameters that specify how much memory to display and how
to format it; addr is an expression giving the address where you want to start displaying
memory. If you use defaults for nfu, you need not type the slash `/'. Several commands
set convenient defaults for addr.
</div>

```bash
n, the repeat count
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
The repeat count is a decimal integer; the default is 1. It specifies how much
memory (counting by units u) to display. 
</div>

```bash
f, the display format
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
The display format is one of the formats used by print (`x', `d', `u', `o',
`t', `a', `c', `f', `s'), and in addition `i' (for machine instructions). The
default is `x' (hexadecimal) initially. The default changes each time you use
either x or print. 
</div>

```bash
u, the unit size 
```

The unit size is any of

b -- bytes.

h -- halfwords (two bytes).

w -- words (four bytes). This is the initial default.

g -- giant words (eight bytes). 

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Each time you specify a unit size with x, that size becomes the default unit the
next time you use x. (For the `s' and `i' formats, the unit size is ignored and is
normally not written.) 
</div>

```bash
addr, starting display address
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
addr is the address where you want GDB to begin displaying memory. The
expression need not have a pointer value (though it may); it is always interpreted
as an integer address of a byte of memory. The default for addr is usually just
after the last address examined--but several other commands also set the default address: info breakpoints (to the address of the last breakpoint listed), info
line (to the starting address of a line), and print (if you use it to display a value
from memory).
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
For example, `x/3uh 0x54320' is a request to display three halfwords (h) of
memory, formatted as unsigned decimal integers (`u'), starting at address 0x54320.
</div>

```bash
disassemble
disassemble /m
disassemble /r
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
This specialized command dumps a range of memory as machine instructions. It
can also print mixed source+disassembly by specifying the /m modifier and print
the raw instructions in hex as well as in symbolic form by specifying the /r. The
default memory range is the function surrounding the program counter of the
selected frame. A single argument to this command is a program counter value;
gdb dumps the function surrounding this value. When two arguments are given,
they should be separated by a comma, possibly surrounded by whitespace. The
arguments specify a range of addresses (first inclusive, second exclusive) to
dump. In that case, the name of the function is also printed (since there could be
several functions in the given range). 
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
The argument(s) can be any expression yielding a numeric value, such as
`0x32c4', `&main+10' or `$pc - 8'. 
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
If the range of memory being disassembled contains current program counter, the
instruction at that location is shown with a => marker. 
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Here is an example showing mixed source+assembly for Intel x86, when the program is
stopped just after function prologue: 
</div>

```bash
(gdb) disas /m main
 Dump of assembler code for function main:
 5 {
 0x08048330 <+0>: push %ebp
 0x08048331 <+1>: mov %esp,%ebp
 0x08048333 <+3>: sub $0x8,%esp
 0x08048336 <+6>: and $0xfffffff0,%esp
 0x08048339 <+9>: sub $0x10,%esp

 6 printf ("Hello.\n");
 => 0x0804833c <+12>: movl $0x8048440,(%esp)
 0x08048343 <+19>: call 0x8048284 <puts@plt>

 7 return 0;
 8 }
 0x08048348 <+24>: mov $0x0,%eax
 0x0804834d <+29>: leave
 0x0804834e <+30>: ret

 End of assembler du
 ```
<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Some architectures have more than one commonly-used set of instruction mnemonics or
other syntax. 
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
For programs that were dynamically linked and use shared libraries, instructions that call
functions or branch to locations in the shared libraries might show a seemingly bogus
location—it's actually a location of the relocation table. On some architectures, gdb might
be able to resolve these to actual function names. 
</div>

## Registers

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Machine registers are where the computer performs arithmetic, performs logic, and tracks
the position of instructions and the call stack.
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
You can refer to machine register contents, in expressions, as variables with names
starting with `$'. The names of registers are different for each machine; use info
registers to see the names used on your machine. 
</div>

```bash
info registers
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Print the names and values of all registers except floating-point and vector
registers (in the selected stack frame). 
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
GDB has four "standard" register names that are available (in expressions) on most
machines--whenever they do not conflict with an architecture's canonical mnemonics for
registers. The register names $pc and $sp are used for the program counter register and
the stack pointer. $fp is used for a register that contains a pointer to the current stack
frame, and $ps is used for a register that contains the processor status. For example, you
could print the program counter in hex with p/x $pc or print the instruction to be executed next with x/i $pc or add four to the stack pointer(10) with  set $sp += 4
</div>

## Examining the symbol table

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
The commands described in this chapter allow you to inquire about the symbols (names
of variables, functions and types) defined in your program. This information is inherent
in the text of your program and does not change as your program executes. GDB finds it
in your program's symbol table.
</div>

```bash
info address symbol
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Describe where the data for symbol is stored. For a register variable, this says
which register it is kept in. For a non-register local variable, this prints the stackframe offset at which the variable is always stored. 
</div>

```bash
info symbol addr
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Print the name of a symbol which is stored at the address addr. If no symbol is
stored exactly at addr, GDB prints the nearest symbol and an offset from it:
</div>

```bash
(gdb) info symbol 0x54320
_initialize_vx + 396 in section .text
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
This is the opposite of the info address command. You can use it to find out the
name of a variable or a function given its address. 
</div>

```bash
info functions
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Prints a list of all function names
</div>

```bash
whatis [arg]
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Print the data type of arg, which can be either an expression or a data type. With
no argument, print the data type of $, the last value in the value history. If arg is
an expression, it is not actually evaluated, and any side-effecting operations (such
as assignments or function calls) inside it do not take place. If arg is a type name,
it may be the name of a type or typedef, or for C code it may have the form
`struct struct-tag', `union union-tag' or `enum enum-tag'.
</div>

```bash
ptype [arg]
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
ptype accepts the same arguments as whatis, but prints a detailed description of
the type, instead of just the name of the type. For example, for this variable
declaration:
</div>

struct complex {double real; double imag;} v;

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
the two commands give this output: 
</div>

```bash
(gdb) whatis v
type = struct complex
(gdb) ptype v
type = struct complex {
 double real;
 double imag;
}
```

## Altering Execution

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Once you think you have found an error in your program, you might want to find out for
certain whether correcting the apparent error would lead to correct results in the rest of
the run. You can find the answer by experiment, using the GDB features for altering
execution of the program.
</div>

### Changing the value of a variable

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
To alter the value of a variable, evaluate an assignment expression.
</div>

```bash
print x=4
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
stores the value 4 into the variable x, and then prints the value of the assignment
expression (which is 4). If you are not interested in seeing the value of the assignment,
use the set var command instead of the print command. set var is really the same as
print except that the expression's value is not printed and is not put in the value history 
</div>

### Calling a function

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
At the gdb prompt, you may call a function and display its return value if any.
</div>

```bash
print expr
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Evaluate the expression expr and display the resulting value. expr may include
calls to functions in the program being debugged. 
</div>

```bash
call expr
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Evaluate the expression expr without displaying void returned values.
You can use this variant of the print command if you want to execute a function
from your program that does not return anything (a.k.a. a void function), but
without cluttering the output with void returned values that GDB will otherwise
print. If the result is not void, it is printed and saved in the value history. 
</div>

## Miscellaneous

### Saving memory to a file

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
You can use the command dump copy data from memory to a file. The dump command
write data to a file,
</div>

```bash
dump [format] memory filename start_addr end_addr
dump [format] value filename expr
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Dump the contents of memory from start_addr to end_addr, or the value of expr,
to filename in the given format. 
</div>

The format parameter may be any one of:

```bash
binary
Raw binary form.
ihex
Intel hex format.
srec
Motorola S-record format.
tekhex
Tektronix Hex format. 
```
<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
GDB uses the same definitions of these formats as the GNU binary utilities, like
`objdump' and `objcopy'. If format is omitted, GDB dumps the data in raw
binary form.
</div>

### Core Files

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
When your program terminates abnormally (e.g. a segmentation fault), Linux creates a
core file which is a binary image of your program at the time of execution. The name of
your core files is core.pid, where pid is the numeric process-id of your program at the
time it was executing. You can use GDB to investigate where your program terminated
by starting GDB with the name of the core file (e.g. gdb core.2367), then doing a
backtrace to show the call stack.
</div>

### Snapshots

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
On certain operating systems, GDB is able to save a snapshot of a program's state, called
a checkpoint, and come back to it later. 
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Returning to a checkpoint effectively undoes everything that has happened in the
program since the checkpoint was saved. This includes changes in memory, registers,
and even (within some limits) system state. Effectively, it is like going back in time to the
moment when the checkpoint was saved. 
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Thus, if you're stepping thru a program and you think you're getting close to the point
where things go wrong, you can save a checkpoint. Then, if you accidentally go too far
and miss the critical statement, instead of having to restart your program from the
beginning, you can just go back to the checkpoint and start again from there. 
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
This can be especially useful if it takes a lot of time or steps to reach the point where you
think the bug occurs. 
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
To use the checkpoint/restart method of debugging: 
</div>

```bash
checkpoint
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Save a snapshot of the debugged program's current execution state. The
checkpoint command takes no arguments, but each checkpoint is assigned a
small integer id, similar to a breakpoint id. 
</div>

```bash
info checkpoints
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
List the checkpoints that have been saved in the current debugging session. For
each checkpoint, the following information will be listed:
Checkpoint ID
Process ID
Code Address
Source line, or label
</div>

```bash
restart checkpoint-id
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Restore the program state that was saved as checkpoint number checkpoint-id. All
program variables, registers, stack frames etc. will be returned to the values that
they had when the checkpoint was saved. In essence, gdb will "wind back the
clock" to the point in time when the checkpoint was saved. 
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Note that breakpoints, GDB variables, command history etc. are not affected by
restoring a checkpoint. In general, a checkpoint only restores things that reside in
the program being debugged, not in the debugger. 
</div>

```bash
delete checkpoint checkpoint-id
```

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Delete the previously-saved checkpoint identified by checkpoint-id. 
</div>

### ddd

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
If you are working on a Linux workstation on campus, or some other PC/Mac that can
render graphics, you can run the debugger named ddd (Data Display Debugger). This
debugger is essentially just a graphical interface for GDB. You can point and click with
your mouse, but the commands have the same names and do the same thing as the
commands in GDB.
</div>
