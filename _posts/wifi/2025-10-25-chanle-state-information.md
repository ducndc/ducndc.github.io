## Channel State Information (CSI)

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
In wireless communications, channel state information (CSI) is the known channel properties of a communication link. This information describes how a signal propagates from the transmitter to the receiver and represents the combined effect of, for example, scattering, fading, and power decay with distance. The method is called channel estimation. The CSI makes it possible to adapt transmissions to current channel conditions, which is crucial for achieving reliable communication with high data rates in multiantenna systems.
</div>

### Mathematical description

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
In a narrowband flat-fading channel with multiple transmit and receive antennas (MIMO), the system is modeled as
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
\( \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{H}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{n} \)
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
where:
</div>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
  <li>\( \mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{C}^{N_r \times 1} \) is the received signal vector.</li>
  <li>\( \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{C}^{N_t \times 1} \) is the transmitted signal vector.</li>
  <li>\( \mathbf{H} \in \mathbb{C}^{N_r \times N_t} \) is the channel matrix, whose element \( h_{i,j} \) represents the complex channel gain from transmit antenna \( j \) to receive antenna \( i \).</li>
  <li>\( \mathbf{n} \in \mathbb{C}^{N_r \times 1} \) is the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) vector, with \( \mathbf{n} \sim \mathcal{CN}(0, N_0 \mathbf{I}) \).</li>
</ul>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Each element \( h_{i,j} \) of the channel matrix contains both the amplitude attenuation and the phase shift experienced by the signal. It can be represented as
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
\( h_{i,j} = |h_{i,j}| e^{j\phi_{i,j}} \)
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
where \( |h_{i,j}| \) is the channel magnitude and \( \phi_{i,j} \) is the channel phase. The collection of these complex coefficients across all antennas and subcarriers (in OFDM systems) forms the Channel State Information (CSI).
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
In practical Wi-Fi systems such as IEEE 802.11n/ac/ax, CSI is estimated using pilot (training) symbols inserted into OFDM subcarriers. These CSI values enable advanced techniques such as beamforming, channel equalization, and device-free sensing applications.
</div>

## CSI Sensing

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
CSI sensing is a technology that uses channel state information (CSI) in Wi-Fi signals to detect human activities (such as walking and breathing) and the state, location, and motion of objects in an environment.
</div>

## How Does CSI Sensing Work?

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
CSI sensing works based on the multipath effect of radio signal propagation and changes to CSI.
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Due to the propagation characteristics of radio signals, the electromagnetic wave signals radiated by a transmit antenna can reach a receive antenna either through a direct path or by reflection off the surrounding environment (such as walls, human bodies, and furniture). Finally, the electromagnetic wave signals reaching the receive antenna are the superposition of direct-path signals and multiple reflection-path signals. This phenomenon is known as the multipath effect of radio signal propagation.
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Environmental changes can result in changes in the reflection paths as well as in CSI data. CSI is an important concept in wireless communications. It provides detailed data of the end-to-end signal transmission process. CSI data, including amplitude attenuation and phase offset during propagation, is carried in subcarriers, which are formed by dividing a channel using Wi-Fi OFDM technology. When no object moves in an environment, the paths of multipath signals are relatively stable, and there are only slight changes to CSI data. When a person or object moves in the space, the signal reflection paths change (for example, a path is blocked or a reflection path is added). As a result, the amplitude and phase of multipath signals change after being superimposed, causing fluctuations in CSI data.
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
By collecting and analyzing the variation pattern of CSI data, CSI sensing technology can detect human presence, identify behaviors, and even measure weak fluctuations due to breathing and heartbeats. For example, when a person is sleeping, the only movements are regular changes in the chest position due to breathing. By extracting the regular changes of CSI, the chest movements can be detected, making it possible to identify whether a person is present.
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Depending on the location relationship between the transmitter and receiver, CSI sensing can be classified as bi-static or mono-static sensing.
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Bi-static sensing: Two devices participate in sensing â€” one sends Wi-Fi signals and one receives Wi-Fi signals.
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
Mono-static sensing: The same device is used to receive and send Wi-Fi signals. For example, the CSI sensing function provided by Huawei APs innovatively uses the antenna-algorithm co-design to minimize non-ideal factors and strong self-interference between the transmitter and receiver. A single AP can sense centimeter-level movements in the environment using the sonar-like capability, without the need of other devices. This greatly reduces deployment and maintenance costs.
