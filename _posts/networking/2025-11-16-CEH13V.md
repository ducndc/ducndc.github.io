Attackers attempt various attack techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in a computer sustem or its security policy and controls in order to fulfil their motives

## Hacker and their Motivations
1. White Hat Hackers
2. Black Hat Hackers
3. Gray Hat Hackers
4. State-Sponsored Hackers

## Ethical Hacking
To prevent hackers from gaining access to the organization's information systems
To analyze and strengthen an organization's security posture, including policies, network protection infrastructure, and end-user practices

1. shodan
2. google gemini-cli
3. dnsdumpter
4. netcraft => search DNS
5. wayback machine => history of website
6. peekyou => serach username
7. itelx => search the information, which is pushed to the internet
8. OSINT Framework

## Scanning Network
### Explain Network Scanning Concepts

1. Network Miner 

### Host Discovery Techniques
Used to indentify the active/live system in the network

![H1](/assets/img/networking/discoveryPing.png)

To detect OS of the target machine

nmap -sV --script smb-os-discovery.nse <target>

### Port Scaning 

Categorized according to the type of protocol used for communication

![H1](/assets/img/networking/portScanning.png)

### Nmap Script Engine

smb-os-discovery is an inbuilt script that can be used for collecting OS information on the target machine through the SMB protocol

nmap -sV -p445 --script vuln <target>

### Example about the detail command for scaning

nmap -sV -O -sC -v -oN nmap-win7.txt -p- <target machine>

## Eumeration
### Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)

snmp-check <target machine>
nmap -sV --script snmp-processes <target machine>

### Metasploit
